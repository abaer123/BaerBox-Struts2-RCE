1. python exploit.py http://localhost:9080/orders/3 "CMD" 

Try with different CMDs like
* pwd - where are we?
* whomai - what user are we running this?
* ls -la - what's in my directory?
* ls / - what's my machine
* ls /etc - what else we can find?

## How to Fix!
Use the Nexus Lifecycle Component Information Panel to identify a non-vulnerable version of struts2-core. 
Update the POM to that version and rebuild.You can also rebuild the docker image and run it to retry the attack.

locale for your server is different, then rename package.properties to package_en.properties
and create a new package.properties with proper values for your default locale.
